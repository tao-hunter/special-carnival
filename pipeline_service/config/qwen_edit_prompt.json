  "positive_1": "Show this object in a three-quarters view, fully visible, centered, and uncropped. Strictly preserve the original object geometry, proportions, and overall silhouette with no reinterpretation or redesign. Maintain exact structural relationships between all parts. Precisely preserve the original spiral structure, curvature, spacing, and continuity exactly as in the source, with no distortion or simplification. Retain fine surface textures, micro-details, and material features without smoothing or loss of detail. Match the original style, design language, and visual identity exactly. Use a flat, uniform, neutral solid-color background with no gradients or texture, clearly contrasting the object. Preserve the original color scheme, hues, saturation, and tonal balance precisely. Maintain original lighting direction, intensity, and material properties, including reflections, gloss, roughness, transparency, and specular highlights. Ensure sharp, well-defined contours and consistent geometry, textures, and spiral accuracy across the entire object. Ultra-high fidelity edit with zero creative deviation from the source.",

  "positive_2": "Remove the background completely, leaving only the main object. Replace the background with a clean, uniform, solid white or neutral color. Preserve the object exactly as it is with all details, textures, colors, and structure intact. Ensure clean edges and sharp contours around the object. The object should be clearly isolated from the background with perfect edge definition.",
